Minimum Viable Product:
- ToS
- Build with production Analytics id (localConfig.json) for deployment

Features:
- Hide mobile nav menu on new pageload or click
- Email notifications when courses change
- Add meta description to server-side rendered pages
- Improve performance by testing for unindexed queries with Mongo's notablescan parameter
- Add directives for schedule and course section to reuse code
- Cache GCS authenticated service (make sure it does the right thing when expired)
- Spec page describing data files (and in-page validator)
- Fix course pages so there's a subject in the breadcrumbs and a return link at the end (store last-visited subject and use it if possible)
- Redo schedules using SVG and stop the borders from piling up
- Generated png schedules from svg (https://github.com/sampumon/SVG.toDataURL)
- User-added events
- Use ng-touch for better mobile experience
- Fix back-button scroll-to-last-position
- Implement 'snapshot' as a proper type of data update so I can set the limit on the number of terms in a 'full_terms' update to something sane

Bugs:
- Data update that includes more terms than it claims can cause errors later due to not post-processing terms and subjects in terms that were not listed in ther "terms" field of the update
- Fix display of quicksearch form for mobile
